# Buy me a coffee
This is a mini-project that demonstrates the ability to take payments using Stripe.

> **Note:** The checkout is the test version so no payments are actually processed. Your money is safe! 

The checkout process will work with test credit card data, which you can obtain from [the Stripe website](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

...now I'm off to buy a coffee!
